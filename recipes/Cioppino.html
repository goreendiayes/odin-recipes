            <li>5 cups fish stock</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 pound manila clams, scrubbed</li>
            <li>1 pound mussels, scrubbed, debearded</li>
            <li>1 pound uncooked large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds assorted firm-fleshed fish fillets such as halibut or salom, cut into 2-inch chucks</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a very large pot over medium heat. Add the fennel, onion, shallots, and salt and saute until the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and 3/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and saute 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste. Add tomatoes with their juices, wine, fish stock and bay leaf. Cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until the flavors blend, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the clams and mussels to the cooking liquid. Cover and cook until the clams and mussels begin to open, about 5 minutes. 
                Add the shrimp and fish. Simmer gently until the fish and shrimp are just cooked through, and the clams are completely open, 
                stirring gently, about 5 minutes longer (discard any clams and mussels that do not open). Season the soup, to taste, with more salt and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Ladle the soup into bowls and serve.</li>
        </ol>
